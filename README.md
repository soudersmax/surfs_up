# Surf's Up

### Overview 

The purpose of this analysis is to provide evidence validating the establishment of a surf and ice cream shop in Oahu to a board of investors. 

### Results 

Provide a bulleted list with three major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.

- The average temperature in June is about 75 degrees Fahrenheit, with a range of about +/- 10 degrees

- The average temperature in December is only a little cooler than  June (at 71 degrees Fahrenheit), but the minimum temperature was much lower, at 56 degrees Fahrenheit.

- Though the minimum temperature in December is 15 degrees lower than the average, 75% of the temperatures are much warmer, as denoted by the fact that the 25th percentile is 69 degrees.



### Summary

Overall, I would say that this data supports the establishment, as the average temperature doesn't show much variation over the year. Even in the "cold" season, the minimum temperature is still one at which people might surf or go out shopping. Additionally, the vast majority of that season's temperatures are much warmer, and the overall difference between June and December is not great. 



I would include two more queries to further ensure success for this venture:

1. Precipitation data - looking for trends over the year and comparing that trend to anecdotal and documented trends of surfing numbers
2. Station data - Comparing the location of the different stations and their average observations with the potential planned locations for the shop to ensure that we have the most accurate temperature and precipitation measurements
